It was here where I learned many full stack skills. I learned how to create Restful APIs, webservers, HTML/CSS/Javascript webpages, and much more. Frameworks were used to ease the develpment process so I learned Flask, Angular, and React. I started the year with my capstone where I created a robotic chef, which could accurately dispense ingredients On demand Through a web application. The next semester, I created a CRUD application, which used a relational database in order to manage real estate properties. My final project of my senior year was a Baby AI monitor, which could monitor the movements of a baby, and detect whether or not it was reaching the edge of the crib. I developed quit applications for all three of these projects, integrating both the hardware with software. I worked on everything from the robotics code to the web application. I love setting up my applications on Amazon Web Services because I enjoy being able to access it from anywhere. This got me interested in cloud, technology and so I devlved deepeer into the subject. As a result of having both of my projects on the cloud, I learned quite a bit about cloud technology, and how to create scalable and available cloud applications.'},
